      If you are not familiar with the concept of a sportsbook, it is basically a place where gamblers come together to
      place bets on a variety of outcomes that can take place during a game or even an entire season (e.g. who the NBA
      Finals Champion will be in 2023). Popular sportsbooks like FanDuel and Ceaser’s allow you to place bets for
      tonight’s games both before and during the course of the game, with odds continuously updating as the game
      progresses as mentioned here. Two key things we need to worry about are the odds being offered to us, and the
      juice the comes with them.

      Also known as “the vig”, it is the fee the bookies charge when you are making a bet (similar to how the house
      collects a rake when you play a game of poker in a casino — you are participating in a player-vs-player game, but
      the casino collects a fee generally equal to some small % of the total pot just for organizing and running the
      table). Note that this fee is included directly in the odds the book provides. How so? Well, odds are implied
      probabilities, and the probability of the set of all possible outcomes occurring should sum to 1. However, take a
      look at any sportsbook and we will see this is not the case. This makes it so that no matter what the outcome is,
      the book collects money. Below is a script I wrote to calculate the vig on
      given American money line odds by passing in an array like <code>[290, -360]</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
    def vig(odds_arr):
      """Calculate vig based on odds offered
      Parameters
      ----------
      odds_arr : list
          Odds being offered by a sportsbook
      Returns
      -------
      float
          Vig collected by the sportsbook
      """
      imp_prob_list = []
      for odds in odds_arr:
          if odds > 0:
              # uses formula 1-p/p = odds/100
              implied_prob = 100/(100+odds)
          else:
              implied_prob = abs(odds)/((abs(odds) + 100))
          imp_prob_list.append(implied_prob)
      return sum(imp_prob_list) - 1

    </code></pre>

    <p>
      We can visualize how the book’s vig changes as a function of the money line split (which is what the book offers
      on any straight bet placed i.e. bet placed on the outright winner/loser of a game) pretty easily.

    <h1 id="odds">How Are Odds Set?</h1>

    <p>
      Interestingly, I was not able to find anything about how odds are actually being adjusted throughout live games on
      Fanduel, only for horse racing events which are a type of <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting">parimutuel betting</a> i.e. pool betting. In such pool
      betting, you are not betting against the house but rather against other bettors. To make an analogy, the
      sportsbook functions like an Automated Market Maker, where in this case bettors are trading against a liquidity
      pool which is the pool of bets placed on different horses as opposed to the supply of different cryptocurrencies
      and crypto tokens. The sportsbook algorithm would then regulate the odds offered on racehorses based on bets in
      the pool. Again, this pool betting methodology was only mentioned in the context of FanDuel horse racing. However,
      odds could be adjusted based on the flow of money on either side so Fanduel (the house in this setting) is not
      actively betting against its players (the gamblers using their app), and is instead attempting to keep a neutral
      position while collecting the vig. Alternatively, FanDuel may be playing the role of a traditional market maker.
    </p>

    <p>
      In traditional finance, a market maker warehouses risk and try to determine the fair value of an instrument,
      placing bids below what they perceive as the “fair value” and offers above this value, which is calculated using
      some model. In the context of sports betting, FanDuel data scientists may run some simulations to see how
      simulated games pan out to make a market around the game, team, and player stats. The money line they quote is
      akin to a bid-ask spread.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is the incentive for them to not quote too wide? Imagine a line set wide by a book at +300/-500 on the
      outright winner of a game of basketball between the Knicks and Celtics, where the Knicks are the underdog (and
      thus the Celtics are the favorite to win). Using the function above, we calculate and find the vig to be 8.33%. A
      gambler who sees this line can think of it the following way: the book is willing to pay me $3 for every $1 I
      stake on the Knicks winning (get back any money staked plus an additional $3 for every $1 that was staked) and the
      book is willing to pay me $0.20 for every $1 I stake on the Knicks losing (get back any money staked plus an
      additional $0.20 for every $1 that was staked). This ask may be too high ($1 stake for only a $0.20 win on a
      Knicks loss) and the bid too low ($1 stake for only a $5 win on a Knicks win) so the gambler may pass on betting
      entirely. Note that the gambler could have viewed the line payoff in terms of a Celtics win/loss, and the
      conclusion would be the same: the money line split is too wide resulting in too high of an ask and too low of a
      bid for the gambler to feel comfortable in placing a bet on either side. Therefore, the incentive for the book to
      not quote too wide is increased market participation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conversely, consider a narrow line at +200/-250 on the same game mentioned above in the wide quote scenario. In
      this case, the sportsbook would need to be very confident in the accuracy of their estimate of the true
      probability of the Knicks winning (and Celtics losing) or vice versa, because if it is not, the book cannot be
      confident that the narrow interval will enclose the true probability, resulting in potential losses by those
      gambler’s picking off low offers or high bids due to a tight market being made around the “wrong” point. Note that
      I use the term true probability to differentiate between the implied probability from book odds and the actual
      probability of a team winning).

    <h1 id="close">Closing Positions</h1>

    <p>
      Okay, now that we have vig and odds out of the way, it is probably apparent how you will always be at a severe
      loss trying to play both sides of the book. That is, for a given money line split at a particular point in time,
      if you were to bet on one team winning and the other team winning as well, you would lose anywhere between 5% to
      15% using real odds that sportsbook offers. Now, this is not surprising since if this were a profitable move,
      there would be an arbitrage opportunity. What is surprising, however, is that if one was to seek protection from
      uncertain outcomes, this play can be used to your advantage. When? The answer lies in closing positions.

      The sportsbook FanDuel allows this by offering a Cash Out option, but they give you the short end of the stick:
      If your bet is currently winning, they give you a cash out option that will net you a profit, albeit a not so
      great one, and if your bet is currently losing, the option to cash out may not exist at all, or it is really
      unattractive (10s of cents on the dollar, depending on how far away from being a winning bet it is). Inspired by
      the way I place bets in the first place, which often involves not making directional bets, I realized that hedging
      was the solution to effectively cash out at more attractive prices.
    </p>

    <img src="../assets/hedge.jpeg" style="width: 100%; height: auto; padding : 2em">

    <p>what I did above was a way to cash out on the moneyline bet on the Denver Nuggets to win against the LA Clippers
      without clicking FanDuel’s awful ‘Cashout’ option which would have made me $77.39 - $50.00 = $27.39 regardless of
      whether the Nuggets actually went on to win or lose the game. Instead, using the odds offered on the Clippers
      winning, I placed a $35 bet on the Clippers to win with a total payout of $87.50, meaning I would make $87.50 -
      $35.00 = $52.50 if the Clippers went on to win, and thus netted $2.50 since I would lose the $50.00 bet that the
      Nuggets will win. The other case is that the Nuggets do indeed win the game, in which case the $35 bet on the
      Clippers would pay me nothing, and my net profit would be $150.00 - $50.00 - $35.00 = $65.00, which is alot better
      than the $27.39 profit FanDuel is offering via the Cashout button. Next time you are looking to close out early,
      remember this article and shop around hedge options.
